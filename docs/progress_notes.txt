Here we will write a commentry of our progress. 

Created a folder 'data' in Bowen: /OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/data

To copy data files from the hard drive we used this command: 
scp /D/SN877_0416_CHelliwell_CSIRO_Brapa_gDNA/*.fastq.gz  jam19e@pearcey-i2.hpc.csiro.au:/OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/data


 To copy files from gard drive to Bowen, it is important to understand the file location in hard drive relative to current directory. Use command 'exit' to get out of Pearcey if you are there and then use use command 'cd /' to go to top level of your local system.

Note data is stored in D drive in the external hard drive

README file should be stored at the top level within a git directory (e.g. 2018_CanolaData) and not in sub directories.

To run fastqc on a single file:

	module load fastqc
	fastqc

Then 

fastqc -o OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/processed/fastqc/ /OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/data/Pool1_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz


The -o command redirects the output to a specific location. If this is not specified, the output file will be saved in same location as input files, e.g. /data 

To save this file as a bash script:

	vim fastqc_single_file.sh

And add the command lines as below:

#!/bin/bash
module load fastqc

fastqc -o /OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/processed/fastqc/ /OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/Hiz_Kim/data/Pool1_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz 


To save in vim use exit, :w to save, :q to quit and :wq to save and quit.

Now to run this bash script:

bash scripts/fastqc_single_file.sh    #remember your location in the directory)

To make this script executable use:
chmod +x script.sih
